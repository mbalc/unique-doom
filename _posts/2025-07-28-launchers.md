After messing around a bit in MyHouse.wad as my entry to the whole universe,
I decided to make some better setup for Linux that I could configure later
to automatically sync up between my machines and run on my Steam Deck.

Here's the features I consider essential for me:
- separate saves (and config) per each .wad
- .wad-centric UI with thumbnails
- easy .txt access (for checking technical setup details)
- easy config of multiple source ports with

aunchers that worked on Linux out of the box were a bit meh,
so I sticked with Windows executables + a Proton environment
I wanted to make a setup for Linux

I searched a bit, considered some launchers for me and tried a few of them, 
and in the end - at least for now - I'm sticking with a rather gracelessly
named one, the Doom Launcher, which ticks most of the stuff well enough
for me.
